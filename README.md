# MemoryGame

# Introduction
This game is a built in C++ and mimics the Match Two style memory game. As the user, you have an option between three difficulties
with an increasing amount of cards. Then you input rows and columns to select cards. Following input validation, you are shown if it's a match,
or if you need to try again.

Creation of the project was driven by a desire to practice OOP and various C++ principles.
